# TODO: Add Attractive Landing Page Before Role Selection

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create Frontend/src/components/LandingPage.tsx with an attractive, academic-themed design including a "Get Started" button that navigates to role-selection.
- [x] Update Frontend/src/context/AppContext.tsx to set initial currentPage to 'landing'.
- [x] Update Frontend/src/App.tsx to add a case for 'landing' that renders <LandingPage />.
- [ ] Test the frontend by running the development server to ensure the landing page displays correctly and navigation works.

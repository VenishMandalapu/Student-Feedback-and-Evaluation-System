# Data Consistency Summary

## ✅ Centralized Data Source

All components now use the centralized data from `src/data/mockData.ts`:

### Student Data
- **Total Students**: 400 (100 per department)
- **Departments**: 
  - Computer Science: 100 students
  - Mechanical Engineering: 100 students
  - Electrical Engineering: 100 students
  - Civil Engineering: 100 students

### Teachers
- **Total Teachers**: 5
  - Dr. Sadhana Reddy (Computer Science)
  - Prof. Mallikarjun Rao (Computer Science)
  - Dr. Rajesh Kumar (Mechanical Engineering)
  - Prof. Priya Sharma (Electrical Engineering)
  - Dr. Arun Patel (Civil Engineering)

### Courses
- **Total Courses**: 11
- Each course has 50-80 students enrolled
- Courses are department-specific

## Components Using Centralized Data

### ✅ Admin Components
1. **AdminDashboard.tsx**
   - Uses: `users`, `courses`

2. **StudentManagement.tsx** ✅ UPDATED
   - Uses: `studentsData` (converted to management format)
   - Shows: All 400 students with full details
   - Features: Search, filter, pagination, add/edit/delete

3. **FacultyManagement.tsx**
   - Uses: `users.filter(role === 'teacher')`
   - Shows: All 5 teachers

4. **CourseManagement.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses`
   - Shows: All 11 courses

5. **AdminSettings.tsx**
   - Uses: `users`
   - Shows: Student count (400), Teacher count (5), Admin count (1)

### ✅ Teacher Components
1. **TeacherDashboard.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses` (filtered by teacherId)
   - Shows: Teacher's assigned courses and student counts

2. **StudentInsights.tsx** ✅ NEW
   - Uses: `studentsData`, `courses`
   - Shows: Only students enrolled in teacher's selected course
   - Features: Performance analytics, attendance tracking, filtering

3. **TeacherCourses.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses` (filtered by teacherId)

4. **FeedbackResults.tsx**
   - Uses: `analytics`, `courses`

### ✅ Student Components
1. **StudentDashboard.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses` (filtered by student ID)
   - Shows: Student's enrolled courses

2. **MyCourses.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses` (filtered by student ID)

3. **GiveFeedback.tsx**
   - Uses: `courses`, `feedbackForms`

## Data Flow

```
mockData.ts (Source of Truth)
├── studentsData (400 students)
├── users (405 users: 400 students + 5 teachers + 1 admin)
├── courses (11 courses)
├── feedbackForms
└── analytics

All components import from this single source
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Student Management (Admin)
- View all 400 students
- Search by name/roll number
- Filter by department, year, status
- Pagination (10/25/50/100 per page)
- Performance and attendance tracking
- Add/Edit/Delete students
- Import/Export functionality

### 2. Student Insights (Teacher)
- View only students in selected course
- Performance distribution charts
- Attendance distribution charts
- Filter by performance/attendance
- Search and export
- Color-coded status indicators

### 3. Teacher Login with Course Selection
- Teachers must select a course during login
- Only see data for selected course
- Course stored in app context

## Consistency Checks

✅ All components show same total counts:
- Students: 400
- Teachers: 5
- Courses: 11

✅ All student data comes from `studentsData`
✅ All course data comes from `courses`
✅ All user data comes from `users`

## No Duplicate Data Sources

Previously, `StudentManagement.tsx` had its own `mockStudents` array with only 3 students.
This has been **FIXED** - now uses `studentsData` from centralized source.

All components are now synchronized and consistent!

### **Key Changes Made**

#### 1. **Updated Course Interface**
```typescript
export interface Course {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  code: string;
  teachers: string[];        // Array of teacher names (supports multiple)
  teacherIds: string[];      // Array of teacher IDs (supports multiple)
  students: string[];
  semester: string;
  year: number;
  department: string;        // NEW: Department field
}
```

#### 2. **Updated User Interface**
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'student' | 'teacher' | 'admin';
  email: string;
  department?: string;
  assignedCourse?: string;   // Each teacher has ONE assigned course
}
```

#### 3. **Teacher Login Flow**
- Teacher selects their role
- System shows **only their assigned course** (not a list)
- Teacher must select the course to proceed
- Course selection is stored in app context
- Teacher can only view data for their selected course

### **Data Consistency Across All Pages**
